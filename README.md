# R.E.P.O. mods!

Never done modding before, but R.E.P.O. is fun, so why not give it a shot? :>

## Post Level Summary
A non-invasive mod. No extra advantages, just cool stats! After finishing a level, it gives you:
- ðŸ’° The amount of $ value you extracted vs. the total available.
- ðŸ“¦ The number of items you extracted vs. the total available.
- ðŸ”¨ Total $ value lost due to items smashing & breaking.
- ðŸ’” How many items got wrecked.
- ðŸ‘Š How many hits items took (that made them lose value).
